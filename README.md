# Enhanced Text Tagging with Stanza and HMM

This repository contains code and documentation for training and evaluating a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for part-of-speech (POS) tagging using the Stanza library from StanfordNLP. The code demonstrates how to preprocess the AnCora dataset, train the HMM model, and validate its performance.

## Overview

### Enhanced Tagging with Stanza (StanfordNLP)

**What is Stanza?**

Stanza is a Python library developed by the Stanford NLP group, which provides a unified suite for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It supersedes the older StanfordNLP library.
